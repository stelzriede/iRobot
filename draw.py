# (This is an example similar to an example from the Adafruit fork
#  to show the similarities. Most important difference currently is, that
#  this library wants RGB mode.)
#
# A more complex RGBMatrix example works with the Python Imaging Library,
# demonstrating a few graphics primitives and image loading.
# Note that PIL graphics do not have an immediate effect on the display --
# image is drawn into a separate buffer, which is then copied to the matrix
# using the SetImage() function (see examples below).
# Requires rgbmatrix.so present in the same directory.

# PIL Image module (create or load images) is explained here:
# http://effbot.org/imagingbook/image.htm
# PIL ImageDraw module (draw shapes to images) explained here:
# http://effbot.org/imagingbook/imagedraw.htm
